*Structure*

The company StarThrive is responsible for managing several businesses in the catering and grocery sectors.
It is necessary to develop an application to manage the companies under StarThrive's responsibility.
These companies have different categories and are characterized by their category, name, district, and location (GPS coordinates).

Catering businesses have a significant expense in the form of waiter wages and are thus also characterized by the number of waiters and the average annual salary cost.
They can be separated in the following categories:
- **Cafes**: are further characterized by the average daily number of customers, the average number of coffees sold per day, and the average annual revenue per coffee sold per day.
- **Bakeries**: are further characterized by the average daily number of customers, the number of cakes sold per day, and the average annual revenue per cake sold per day.
- **Restaurants**: can be local restaurants or fast-food establishments. A restaurant is characterized by the average daily number of customers and the number of days of operation per year.
  - **Local restaurant**: characterized by the number of indoor tables, the number of tables on the terrace, the annual license cost per terrace table, and the average revenue per table per day.
  - **Fast-food restaurant**: characterized by the number of indoor tables, the average revenue per table per day, the average daily number of drive-thru customers, and the average daily revenue per drive-thru customer.

Grocery category companies can be fruit shops or markets:
- **Fruit shops**: are characterized by the number of products, the average annual revenue per product, and the annual establishment cleaning cost.
- **Markets**: are characterized by type (mini, super, hyper), corridor area (m2), average annual revenue per m2, and annual establishment cleaning cost.

Since one of the main objectives of the StarThrive company is managing annual expenses and revenues, there are different ways for calculating the annual expenses and revenues of each category.
